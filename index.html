        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Genesis Pascual. Iâ€™m a current senior undergraduate Biochemistry student at the University of California, Riverside. I am originally from Los Angeles, CA born and raised. Before becoming a Ucr student I transferred from Santa Monica community college where I conducted research in carotenoid extraction. Where I gained first-hand experience in research and won a symposium hosted by the school. Which lead me aspire to work in a Laboratory either to manufacture or research new revolutionary ways to help improve pharmaceuticals products for responsible pain management more so focusing with patients with joint pain. I myself have had to deal with this issue also seeing my own mother suffer from pain day to day has helped motivate me to aspired to peruse better treatment options. As we know we are only 2 of many other people who have to deal with these same exact issues and I want to help be a part of helping them feel a bit better than they did before. My main goal is having the opportunity to help others in my community combat their issues because as we know not many individuals can handle pain management and abuse prescription. Leading to more issues like drug addiction and Iâ€™m hoping with the knowledge I know I can later help other help themselves live better productive lives.<br><br>
        Outside of school and my aspirations, I enjoy watching movies with friends and family. Alongside binge watching shows on platforms like Hulu, Netflix, and Tlc. I sometimes find myself picking up other hobbies like knitting but I say it more of a season hobby more so in the winter. Although I do love going out to eat and try new foods I donâ€™t think it applies as a hobby but I do think I am a foodie who loves to try all sorts of new food from different cultures. I do also enjoy cooking and baking with family specially during the holidays. Like others it depends what my current interests are at the time. I do hope to acquire other hobbies in the future but with my busy schedule it will have to do for now.<br><br>
        Personal traits that distinguish me from others is my work ethic coming from such hard-working parents who have been working all their lives. I have learned that everything I want needs to be earned nothing really is ever given to us unless we work hard for it. When we do something form the hardest to the simplest tasks we need to give it our all. This will result in better outcomes if it comes from a good place within us. I pride myself in being a reliable individual that gets the job done at all costs and if needed I will be there without a doubt. I am very consistent with my work delivery and with no doubt no matter the work environment I will succeed. Given the opportunity I will not fail in whichever direction I decide going with the job will get done.
